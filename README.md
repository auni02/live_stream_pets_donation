# live_stream_pets_donation

The Live Stream Pet Donation App is a mobile-based system designed to support animal shelters in Malaysia by enabling real-time donations through live streaming. The application integrates TikTok Live streaming with an IoT-based automated food dispensing system, allowing donors to immediately see the impact of their contributions.

When a donation is made during a live stream, the system triggers an IoT food dispenser via a Raspberry Pi, providing instant visual feedback as food is dispensed to the animals. This approach improves transparency, emotional engagement, and donor trust, addressing common limitations of traditional fundraising methods used by animal shelters.

The project was developed using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, allowing iterative prototyping and continuous user feedback. Key technologies used include Flutter for the mobile application,  Firebase console backend management, Firebase for real-time data handling, and Python with Raspberry Pi for IoT control.

This project demonstrates the integration of TikTok live streaming, mobile applications, and IoT systems to create a scalable and interactive digital fundraising platform.
